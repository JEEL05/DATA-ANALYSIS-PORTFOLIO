I am passionate about:
- **Uncovering patterns and trends** in complex datasets
- **Building interactive dashboards** to track KPIs and performance metrics
- **Using tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau** to solve real-world problems

### **What I Bring**
- A strong foundation in **data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**
- **Experience with business-focused analysis** such as FMCG sales trends, promo impact studies, and stockout risk detection
- Ability to **translate data into actionable insights**, supporting business growth and strategy

### **Beyond Data**
When I’m not analyzing datasets, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and sharing my learnings through GitHub. I’m driven by the excitement of **turning raw data into meaningful narratives and solutions**.

This repository is designed to **showcase my skills, share my projects, and track my progress** in Data Analytics and Data Science.
